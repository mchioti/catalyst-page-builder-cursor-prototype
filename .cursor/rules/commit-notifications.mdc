# Commit & Push Workflow

When the user asks to "commit and push" or "create a milestone summary and push":

## 1. Update Notification Bell

Before committing, update the `MOCK_NOTIFICATIONS` array in `src/components/Notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`:

- Add new milestone notifications at the **top** of the array
- Use sequential IDs like `milestone-1`, `milestone-2`, etc.
- Set `read: false` for new items, `read: true` for older ones
- Use appropriate icons in titles: ✨ (features), 🔗 (connections), 💾 (storage), 🏛️ (architecture), 📝 (UI), ✅ (fixes), 🐛 (bugs)
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Set `createdAt` to current date/time in ISO format

### Notification Structure

```typescript
{
  id: 'milestone-X',
  type: 'success' | 'feature' | 'info' | 'warning' as const,
  category: 'release' | 'bugfix' | 'system',
  title: '🎯 Short Title',
  description: 'Concise description of what was achieved.',
  createdAt: '2026-01-13T18:00:00Z', // Use current date
  read: false,
}
```

## 2. Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
```
feat: Brief summary of changes

- Bullet point details
- Another detail
```

## 3. Push to Remote

Always push to `origin main` after committing.

## 4. Also Update milestoneNotifications.ts (Optional)

For major milestones, also update `src/utils/milestoneNotifications.ts` with the `SESSION_MILESTONES` array for programmatic access to milestone data.
